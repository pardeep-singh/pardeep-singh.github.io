                <ul>
                    <li>Joined the team during stealth mode and became the Subject matter expert on Risk models used to assess insurance risk. Lead Multiple projects in this area.</li>
                    <li>Proposed an architecture to deploy models to productions. Performed two extensive POCs using Qwak and MLFlow. Choose MLFlow based on a comparison with Qwak and Sagemaker. This will reduce the time we take for moving models from research to production by 80%.</li>
                    <li>Proposed a solution to fix existing version of the models. I was responsible for the end-to-end implementation along with an extensive evaluation to ship this change to production.</li>
                    <li>Implemented a feature to identify the areas of improvement for different drivers to help them make safer drivers. Used ensembled tree based solution to identify such factors. Improved the accuracy of this feature in the next iteration by 10%(from 86% to 96%) by using a deterministic Non ML-based solution.</li>
                    <li>Lead the efforts to benchmark existing Risk Models. This work enabled the team to identify shortcomings of current models and devise a plan to overcome them in the next version of Risk Models.</li>
                    <li>Implemented a Streamlit-based dashboard to monitor Risk Models. This reduced the time taken to debug model issues from days to hours.</li>
                    <li>Productionized the new version of Risk models. Along with implementation, I did the end-to-end impact analysis of new models on Insurance books.</li>
                    <li>Responsible for hiring new team members across Senior Software, Machine Learning Engineer, and Data Scientists roles.</li>
                    <li>Organizer of weekly technical talks for the Engineering Team. Organized over 15+ sessions so far.</li>
                    <li>Mentored 3 new joiners by becoming their buddy for the first month of joining the team.</li>
